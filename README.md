# OIT-portal
# Overview of what sections the portal should serve:
<p>The portal will be used by both (prospective) and admitted(returning) students</p>
At inception, every user is prospective:<br>
a) This implies that anyone/everyone is welcome to JOIN US.<br>
<p>Once a prospect joins us, a dashboard is created (Where he/she can register for either full-time or part-time course, schorlarship program etc)</p>
<p>The requirement for each of the course section differs for example, if the student is registering for a crash (or part-time) course, we do not need the JAMB result, but if s/he is registering for a full-time course, we will need both JAMB and WAEC results.</p>
<p>In addition to the WAEC and JAMB result, we will also need to collect:<br>
a) Student Biodata<br>
b) Parents/Guardian (For full-time and schorlarship students)<br>
c) Next of kin data.<br>
<p>Then, if the student is admitted into the full-time course, they will be prompted to update their profile with passport, Genotype and Blood group.</p>

<p> Staff registration should only be done by: The Admin allocates a username and password to every staff where they are mandated to Update their profile, so no one can create a profile as a staff.</p>
<p>In the process of a staff updating his/her records, there should be a way also to register the courses he/she is taken (subject to approval from the central Admin before it could be displayed to the students)</p>
<p>Once the student is admitted, s/he can:<br>
a) see the courses s/he is taken and which lecturer is taken it.<br>
b) <this could be in the long run> his performances at a glance.<br>
c) Report a Lecturer (ha ha) <br>
d) Report fellow students in event of abuse<br>
e) Request to be absent from school <br>
f) <conventional school mgt activities though><br>
      
   
## OTHER FEATURES (This might not be factored into the current state)
1. Each Department of the school is featured in the app so that, the student can interact with them through a click<br>
a) Health Section<br>
b) Library<br>
c) Account etc<br>

## DATA COLLECTION REQUIREMENT FOR EVERY USER ON THE PORTAL
   
<p>User Registration _(I have a challenge here, if someone is not interested in pursuing a course with us, what need will it be for the person to have a dashboard? How do we regulate access to the dashboard to ensure that not all users have access to the dashboard? Here is what I think, once a user registers, a mail is sent to him acknowledging his registration, then a link to join us will be in the mail where he can then create username and password to access the dashboard)_</p>
